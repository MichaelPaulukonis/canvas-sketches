## trying out fragment-tools

## insidious-motorcycle

- manually inc/dec vectors/vector amounts
- zoom in/out of source
- rewind - go forward/backward with the vectors
- https://www.gorillasun.de/blog/a-guide-to-making-gifs-in-p5js-and-processing/ noise loops
- work from center or other locations instead of just "upper-left"
- image inset offsets like this book design:

## image-shaper

- originally @ https://editor.p5js.org/MichaelPaulukonis/sketches/cg_LK7asX
- used to create a zipped pair of a cutout image with the vectors of that cutout
- the file is then imported by another collage-program of mine

### roadmap

- shape "library"
  - see the thing used for .... that other thing.
  - the one that was mostly dumb html
- load existing vectors onto image
- standard shapes
  - including text <https://erraticgenerator.com/blog/p5js-texttopoints-function/>
- bezier curves, wooo!
- ~~rotation~~
- ~~edit vectors once drawn (prior to render)~~
- better handling of in/out sizes
  - semi-handled, but we should display size and allow shrinking
- some semblance of a UI

  - https://programmingdesignsystems.com/shape/procedural-shapes/index.html
  - contours are the p5js term for "holes" in a shape

## Agressive Text Waves

If I told you this bore a resemblance to XRAYSMONALISA would that mean anything to you?
